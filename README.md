## BLackoutDNS

*Why need a proxy when you have a DNS?* - DotLYHiyou, Creator of this project.

This is a simple DNS server that gets around school firewall restrictions. Support to get around tools such as GoGuardian, CKAuth, or whatever other schools use as restriction tools. idk I only have access to GoGuardian. Built 80% using AI. Probably gonna rework it when I completely learn Javascript to its core and advanced stuff.

## How to use?

 You should see a section labeled "Favorite Networks"
